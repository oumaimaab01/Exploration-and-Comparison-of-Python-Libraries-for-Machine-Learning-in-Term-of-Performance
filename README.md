<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The era of Big Data requires the use of Machine Learning and Data Science, where Python and its numerous libraries are favored for data processing.
In this regard, this project aimed to explore and compare the performance of the seven most commonly used Python libraries in machine learning and data science: ####Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

The first part of the project focused on the exploration of these libraries. introducing the 
term Machine Learning and highlighting the key differences among these libraries in terms of 
portability across different programming languages (Python, C++, Java...) and the utilization 
of CPU and GPU. Then presenting the algorithms that would be implemented for the different Python libraries in ML.

For the second part, which aimed to practically study these libraries, using two datasets: 
one for classification problems (Iris dataset) and another for regression problems 
(California_Housing). Our goal was to identify the main differences among these libraries for 
the chosen algorithms based on three criteria: accuracy measurement (accuracy in 
classification, mean squared error in regression), execution time measurement, and ease of 
use.

By the end of this project, the objective is to be able to choose the most appropriate library to 
solve any machine learning-related problems that we may encounter as future engineers in 
data science and analysis.
